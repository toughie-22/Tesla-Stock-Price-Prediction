📈 Tesla Stock Price Prediction

Predicting the future is hard. Predicting stock prices? Even harder. But with the right mix of data science, machine learning, and curiosity, we can uncover patterns that bring us closer to making sense of financial markets.

This project focuses on Tesla (TSLA) — one of the most volatile and talked-about stocks of the decade. Using historical price data and machine learning, we build and evaluate models to forecast Tesla’s stock price movement.


🔍 Project Overview

Objective: To analyze Tesla’s historical stock data and predict future price trends.

Approach:

i. Data preprocessing and visualization

ii. Feature engineering from historical data

iii. Machine learning model training & evaluation

iv. Comparison of predictions against real values

Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

⚙️ Workflow

i. Data Collection – Obtained Tesla’s historical stock price data.

ii. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized price trends, moving averages, and volatility.

iii. Data Preprocessing – Handled missing values, normalized data, and created train/test splits.

iv. Modeling – Trained predictive models (e.g., LSTM, Linear Regression, Random Forest).

v. Evaluation – Compared performance metrics (RMSE, MAE) across models.

v. Prediction – Generated forecasts and visualized actual vs predicted prices.

📊 Key Insights

Tesla’s stock shows strong short-term volatility but with identifiable trends.

Machine learning models can capture the overall price trajectory, though precise day-to-day predictions remain challenging.

LSTM models performed better at capturing time-dependent patterns compared to traditional regression models.

🚀 Why This Project Matters

Stock market prediction isn’t just about numbers — it’s about learning how to turn raw data into actionable insights. This project demonstrates:

i. The power of machine learning in financial forecasting.

ii. The importance of data preprocessing & visualization in making sense of complex datasets.

iii. How experimentation with different models sharpens problem-solving and critical thinking.
